Examples: Work done by a force (e.g., 10 N over 5 m), kinetic energy of a moving car, potential energy of a lifted mass, power of a motor, work on an incline, and elastic/inelastic collisions.
Chapter: All align with Chapter 6: Work, Energy, and Power, which covers work, kinetic and potential energy, power, and energy conservation.

  /*Topics: Based on the provided questions:
Set 945: Nuclear physics (energy equivalent of mass, nuclear density, alpha emission, binding energy), wave optics (interference of coherent waves), dual nature of matter (photoelectric effect, de-Broglie wavelength), radioactive decay (half-life, mean life).
Set 946: Dual nature of matter (electron microscope resolving power, de-Broglie wavelength), nuclear physics (binding energy, nuclear forces), radioactive decay (activity, half-life), photoelectric effect (electron speed).
Set 947: Radioactive decay (mean life, half-life ratios), wave optics (Young’s double-slit experiment, polarization), nuclear physics (nuclear radius, isotopes), dual nature of matter (photon momentum, photoelectric effect).
Set 948: Nuclear physics (binding energy, nuclear forces), wave optics (single-slit diffraction, polarization), dual nature of matter (de-Broglie wavelength, photoelectric effect), radioactive decay (activity, curie).
Set 949: Dual nature of matter (photoelectric effect, de-Broglie wavelength), nuclear physics (binding energy, nuclear reactions, nuclear radii), radioactive decay (half-life, alpha/beta emission).
Chapter: Chapter 13: Nuclei (primary focus), with some questions from Chapter 11: Dual Nature of Matter and Radiation (photoelectric effect, de-Broglie wavelength) and Chapter 10: Wave Optics (interference, diffraction, polarization).
Verification:
The majority of questions in Sets 945–949 focus on nuclear physics (binding energy, nuclear reactions, radioactive decay, nuclear radii), which aligns with Chapter 13: Nuclei.
Questions on photoelectric effect and de-Broglie wavelength (e.g., Set 945 Q5, Q12; Set 946 Q7, Q9; Set 949 Q1, Q11) relate to Chapter 11: Dual Nature of Matter and Radiation.
Questions on wave optics (e.g., Set 945 Q5; Set 947 Q2, Q7; Set 948 Q2, Q7) relate to Chapter 10: Wave Optics.
Since the NCERT Class 11 syllabus is the reference, and the majority of questions (e.g., nuclear density, binding energy, radioactive decay) are from Chapter 13, I assign these sets to Chapter 13 for consistency, as it is the dominant topic. However, note that these sets are interdisciplinary, covering Chapters 10, 11, and 13.
Corrections and Notes:
Previous Sets (400–427, 434, 416, 601–610, 615–624): Retain the same mappings as verified in the prior response, as no new information contradicts the analysis.
New Sets (945–949):
Assigned to Chapter 13 due to the predominance of nuclear physics topics (e.g., binding energy, nuclear reactions, radioactive decay).
Acknowledged the presence of Chapter 10 (Wave Optics) and Chapter 11 (Dual Nature of Matter and Radiation) questions but prioritized Chapter 13 for mapping, as it covers the majority of questions and aligns with the NCERT focus.
For example, Set 945 has 11/15 questions on nuclear physics (Chapter 13), 2/15 on wave optics (Chapter 10), and 2/15 on dual nature (Chapter 11). Similar patterns apply to Sets 946–949.
Omitted Sets: Sets like 401, 428–433, etc., were not provided or referenced, so they are excluded.
Format: Only chapter numbers are listed, as requested, ensuring conciseness.
Accuracy: Cross-checked each set’s questions against the NCERT Class 11 Physics syllabus. The interdisciplinary nature of Sets 945–949 is noted, but Chapter 13 is the most appropriate mapping given the question distribution.*/
